Problem 1: Write a code to compute the passive evolution of a stellar population whose star
formation shuts off at time t=0. For the sake of simplicity, you can assume that all stars
are on the Main Sequence (i.e., when they die, they effectively disappear rather than
become giants)

Assume that at time t=0, the stellar population has a Salpeter mass function and contains
stars of all masses in the range 0.08 â€“ 50Msun

1. Calculate the total luminosity of the stellar population as a function of time in units of
its starting luminosity L0 . Then convert this to absolute magnitude: M(t)-M(0), the
difference between the absolute magnitude at time t and that at time t=0.
Plot M(t)-M(0) as a function of time (make the x-axis run from 0 to 10Gyr).

Steps: 
1. Define the Salpeter Mass Function.  IMF(m)*dm = IMF_init (m / M_sun)^-2.35 * (dm/M_sun)
	This states: The number of stars in each bin of mass is equal to the number of stars
	in the suns 'bin' of mass times the fractional mass to the minus 2.35, times the bin
	of mass normalized to the sun.  Note: IMF(m) = N(m) sometimes referred to by XI.

2. To get the total luminosity at initial time, integrate the IMF over all masses and compute.
	Note:  L / L_sun = (Mass / Mass_sun) ^ alpha,   where [1<alpha<6.]  ~3.5. 
	A variable alpha should be considered given that the range is outside of [2<mass<20].
	(The first generation of code will assume: alpha = 3.5.)
	

3. Recomute the bounds of integration given the main sequence lifetime, in bins of time. 
	Note: Ideally the bins of time would not be standardly spaced by would scale with
	the time since t=0 to account for the varying rate of decay. 
		* Assuming 0 --> 10 Gyrs, a spacing of 1 Myrs would lead to 10,000 bins. 
		
4. Integrate over the new bounds for the new luminosity until 10Gyr. 

5. Convert Luminosity to absolute Magnitude and plot Results. 
	M_bol = -2.5 * log_b10[( L / L_sun )]. 

6. Plot the Magnitude difference as a function of time.
